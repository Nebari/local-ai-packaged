# OpenWebUI Integration Guide for PraisonAI Teams

## Adding PraisonAI Teams as Models in OpenWebUI

### Step 1: Access OpenWebUI Admin Settings
1. Go to https://openwebui.nebarisoftware.com
2. Click on your profile (bottom left)
3. Select "Admin Panel"
4. Navigate to "Settings" â†’ "Models"

### Step 2: Add PraisonAI API Connection
1. Click "Add Model"
2. Configure the following:

**Model Configuration:**
```json
{
  "name": "PraisonAI Teams",
  "base_url": "http://praisonai-teams:8000/v1",
  "api_key": "not-required",
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "research-team",
      "name": "Research Team",

### Step 3: Alternative Manual Addition
If the above doesn't work, add each team as a separate model:

1. **Research Team Model:**

   - Base URL: `http://praisonai-teams:8000/v1`
   - Model ID: `research-team`

2. **Coding Team Model:**

   - Base URL: `http://praisonai-teams:8000/v1`
   - Model ID: `coding-team`

3. **Business Team Model:**

### Step 4: Usage in OpenWebUI

Once configured, you can:

1. Select any PraisonAI team from the model dropdown
2. Start chatting - your messages will be processed by the multi-agent team
3. Each team will collaborate to provide comprehensive responses

**Example Prompts:**

- **Research Team**: "Research the latest trends in AI and machine learning for 2024"

- **Business Team**: "Analyze the market opportunity for a new fintech startup"
- **Creative Team**: "Create a marketing campaign for a sustainable fashion brand"

### Step 5: Monitoring and Logs

docker logs praisonai-teams -f

# Check API status
